## 4. Outstanding Work
- None.

## 5. Risks, Open Questions, and Assumptions
- Risk: TypeScript build / proxy code removed; `package.json` no longer includes TypeScript/dev deps.
  - Status: Resolved
  - Date opened: 2026-02-11
  - Resolution: This repo no longer ships or supports `ccx`, so proxy build tooling is intentionally removed.
- Risk: `npm install` in this repo fails due to `bin/preinstall.js` (npx-only enforcement), limiting local verification.
  - Status: Open
  - Date opened: 2026-02-11
  - Current assumption: Verification relies on installer script syntax checks and text search, not `npm` builds.

## 6. Verification Status
- Verified:
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-02-11 21:45 CST)
  - Grep for `ccx` / `claude-proxy` across key files => no matches in `README.md`, `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `package.json`, `bin/*` (2026-02-11 21:45 CST)
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-02-11 21:54 CST)
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-02-11 21:59 CST)
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-03-08 13:33 CDT)
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-04-17 18:10 CDT)
  - Grep sanity for ccg46/ccg51: 2 new bash wrappers, 2 new PowerShell wrappers, all alias/function/shim pairs present (2026-04-17 18:10 CDT)
- Not yet verified:
  - PowerShell script execution on Windows (reason: not run in this environment)

## 7. Restart Instructions
- Starting point:
  1. Phase 8 edits are in the working tree (uncommitted): `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`, `PROJECT_LOG.md`.
  2. Version bumped to 2.2.0.
  3. Prior untracked MoAI-ADK files (`.mcp.json`, `.moai/`, `CLAUDE.md`) are now tracked (added in commit `bac6bdf`); `.gitignore` has pending edits.
- Recommended next actions:
  1. Run `bash install.sh` locally, choose option 2 "Reset wrappers/aliases using existing API key" to materialize new wrappers and add aliases to `~/.bashrc`.
  2. After sourcing, verify `ccg51`, `ccg51D`, `ccg51Dd`, `ccg46`, `ccg46D`, `ccg46Dd` launch Claude Code with the correct model IDs.
  3. Commit Phase 8 changes and optionally run Windows-side smoke test.
