## 4. Outstanding Work
- None.

## 5. Risks, Open Questions, and Assumptions
- Risk: TypeScript build / proxy code removed; `package.json` no longer includes TypeScript/dev deps.
  - Status: Resolved
  - Date opened: 2026-02-11
  - Resolution: This repo no longer ships or supports `ccx`, so proxy build tooling is intentionally removed.
- Risk: `npm install` in this repo fails due to `bin/preinstall.js` (npx-only enforcement), limiting local verification.
  - Status: Open
  - Date opened: 2026-02-11
  - Current assumption: Verification relies on installer script syntax checks and text search, not `npm` builds.

## 6. Verification Status
- Verified:
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-02-11 21:45 CST)
  - Grep for `ccx` / `claude-proxy` across key files => no matches in `README.md`, `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `package.json`, `bin/*` (2026-02-11 21:45 CST)
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-02-11 21:54 CST)
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-02-11 21:59 CST)
  - `bash -n install.sh` => OK (2026-03-08)
- Not yet verified:
  - PowerShell script execution on Windows (reason: not run in this environment)

## 7. Restart Instructions
- Starting point:
  1. Review current diff: `git diff` and `git status`.
  2. Ensure no unintended references remain to deleted proxy code (already grepped in-session).
  3. If desired, run Windows-side smoke test: execute `install.ps1` in PowerShell and confirm aliases/shims `ccg5`, `ccg47`, `ccf` work.
- Recommended next actions:
  1. If you want a clean tree, decide what to do with untracked local files: `.mcp.json`, `.moai/`, `CLAUDE.md`.
  2. Create a git commit capturing the GLM-5 + ccx removal changes.
